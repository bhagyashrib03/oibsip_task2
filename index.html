                <h3>Childhood & Early Life</h3>
                <p>Lata Mangeshkar was born on September 28, 1929 in Indore, Central Provinces (now Madhya Pradesh). She was the eldest daughter among the five children of Dinanatha and Shevanti Mangeshkar who belonged to a Maharashtrian Brahmin family. Dinanath hailed from the town of Mangeshi in Goa and he changed his last name from Haridkar to Mangeshkar in identify with his hometown. Her father Pandit Deenanath Mangeshkar was an accomplished classical singer and stage actor. Lata was initially named Hema when she was born, but later her father renamed her as Lata, inspired by a character in one of his plays. She had four siblings, three sisters, Meena, Asha and Usha; and one brother, Hridaynath. All five Mangeshkar siblings learned classical music from their father.</p>
                <p>Lata started acting in her father's musical plays since the age of five. She also took lessons in classical music from maestros like Amanat Khan, Pandit Tulsidas Sharma and Aman Ali Khan Saheb later in life. She was inspired by K.L. Saigal's music when she was young. She did not receive a formal education as she did not attend school. PanditDinanath passed away when Lata was just 13 years old and as the eldest child, the financial responsibility of the family came to rest upon Lata's shoulders.</p>
                <p>In a career spanning nearly eight decades, Lata Mangeshkar was the singing voice for a bevy of Bollywood leading ladies. She lent her voice to over 5,000 songs in over a thousand Hindi and 36 regional films. She had an unprecedented impact on Indian film music. Since 1942, Lata pushed back the boundaries of music with her mind-boggling skills. Over the years, Lata had sung for actresses from Madhubala to Priyanka Chopra. Best known for her versatile voice quality, she recorded albums of all kinds</p>
                <p>Lata Mangeshkar passed away from multiple organ dysfunction syndrome on 6 February 2022, at the age of 92.</p>
